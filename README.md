# HEXFlow Covers
Cover images for HEXFlow.

This is a collection of some simple and tidy *(nearly official-like)* cover images for VitaHEX Games' "HEXFlow" launcher, a fantastic launcher made available for Sony PSVITA.
At the moment the collection is quite small, but I will extend it in my spare time.

As mentioned by VitaHEX:
> Place your custom covers in "ux0:/data/HexFlow/COVERS/PSVITA/"

Since all cover images have to be named by the App ID of the game, I have named them "AppID.png".
HEXFlow will search for suitable cover images and show them instead of the game icon (default).

**Note:** At the moment there are only EU-covers available.
As soon as there are enough covers for a solid basis, I will release the sources as .PSD file for Photoshop. Have fun!

*Asphalt Injection, Assassin's Creed Games, Dungeon Hunter, Minecraft, Need For Speed, Ridge Racer, Uncharted, WRC Series... - just to name a few.*
