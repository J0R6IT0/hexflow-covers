# HEXFlow Covers
Cover images for HEXFlow.

This is a collection of cover images for VitaHEX Games' "HEXFlow" launcher, available for Sony PSVITA.
At the moment it is quite small, but I will extend it in my spare time.

As mentioned by VitaHEX:
> Place your custom covers in "ux0:/data/HexFlow/COVERS/PSVITA/"

Since all cover images have to be named by the App ID of the game, I have named them "AppID.png".
HEXFlow will search for suitable cover images and show them instead of the game icon (default).

**Note:** At the moment there are only EU-covers available.
