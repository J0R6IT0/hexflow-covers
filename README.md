# HEXFlow Covers
Cover images for HEXFlow.

This is a collection of some simple and tidy *(nearly official-like)* cover images for VitaHEX Games' "HEXFlow" launcher, a fantastic launcher made available for Sony PSVITA.
The collection is constantly growing...

## What you need?

As mentioned by VitaHEX:
> Place your custom covers in "ux0:/data/HexFlow/COVERS/PSVITA/"

Since all cover images have to be named by the App ID of the game, I have named them "AppID.png". A listing with the associated game names is included.
HEXFlow will search for suitable cover images and show them instead of the game icon (default).

**Note:**<br>
At the moment most of the covers are EU-covers. You can file an issue for cover requests if you want.<br>
A .PSD file for Adobe Photoshop is available now too, where you can create your own covers!<br>
Have fun!
