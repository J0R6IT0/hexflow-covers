# HEXFlow Covers
Cover images for HEXFlow.

This is a collection of some simple and tidy cover images for VitaHEX Games' "HEXFlow" launcher, available for Sony PSVITA.
At the moment the collection is quite small, but I will extend it in my spare time.

## What you need?

As mentioned by VitaHEX:
> Place your custom covers in "ux0:/data/HexFlow/COVERS/PSVITA/"

Since all cover images have to be named by the App ID of the game, I have named them "AppID.png".
HEXFlow will search for suitable cover images and show them instead of the game icon (default).

**Note:** At the moment there are only EU-covers available.

*Asphalt Injection, Assassin's Creed Games, Dungeon Hunter, Minecraft, Need For Speed, Ridge Racer, Uncharted, WRC Series... - just to name a few.*
